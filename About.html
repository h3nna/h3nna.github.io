<h1>About</h1>
<p>From family separation across the US-Mexico border to deaths in the Mediterranean Sea, migration is a highly debated, contentious topic in mainstream politics. Across countries and regions, the stories told about migrants in the mainstream media are, at best, incomplete and fragmentary, and, at worst, vitriolic and incendiary. The rhetoric surrounding migration often deepens divides, ignites hostilities and entrenches conflict.</p>
<p>This rhetoric, however, rarely reflects the lived experiences of migrants themselves.  Using the power of public narrative, Migrant Monologues will highlight powerful stories and experiences of  immigrants and individuals directly affected by migration (documented and undocumented) across different communities.</p>
<p>We will focus on the reasons that drive people to migrate, their experiences along the way, and the challenges and hopes facing migrants in the the world today. Migrant Monologues seeks to bridge our policy discussions with the lived experiences of migrants who are present in our everyday lives.</p>
